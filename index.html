            <p>
                i developed a neural network from scratch using only python and numpy. i focussed on both the underlying 
                mathematical concepts and practical implementation with well documented and well written code. This project 
                required researching machine learning theory, 
                writing efficient code using numpy, and applying problem-solving skills to optimise performance. 
                it gave me hands-on experience with model design, training algorithms, and debugging complex 
                behaviours—showcasing both my technical ability and self-motivation. The project reflects my love for understanding
                complex mathematic systems and applied problem solving.
